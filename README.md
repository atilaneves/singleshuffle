singleshuffle
================

A music player app for Android. I wrote / am writing this
for my own particular needs. I have no need or interest
in playlists and I want a music player app that does this:

1. Plays singles in shuffle mode
2. Plays album songs in order

Where the singles are all in one big unorganised folder and
the albums are each in their own folder, possibly with
hierarchical levels (e.g. band/album/songs).

This might not be the player for everyone, but it scratches
my own particular itch. Also, it's free and has no ads.
